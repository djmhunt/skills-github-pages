## Intro

Hello! While my interests dovetail into many areas, I look at the world proincipally through the lens of a computational modeller: someone who uses using data and simulations of mathematical simplifications to try and better understand what is going on and predict what might happen next.

I currently teach applied data analytics to professionals in the public and private sector. In practice this means I coach people who work with any kind of information on tools, techniques and perspectives that can help them to automate, simplify and take their job to the next level. My work includes creating course material for a new undergraduate in digital and technology solutions.

My personal interest is in emergent behaviour in all contexts, but especially in social dynamics. I am interested in understanding how people interact, how those interactions are shaped by our environment and how in turn our interactions shape our environment. This led me to getting a PhD in Psychology, modelling human learning in decision-making.

I love to generalise: to find solutions that covers most cases, not just the most common ones.

I have been lucky that my work has provided opportunities to dip my toes in a variety of different social and computational topics, from molecular modelling, neuroscience, through to economics and even anthropology.

I listen to a lot of podcasts to learn about the world, so I put together a list of the 10 podcasts I most looked forward to listening to in 2020. They are in no particular order as they cover such varied topics. The list left out some great podcasts, some honourable mentions are appended at the end for good measure.

## [Power Corrupts](https://www.powercorruptspodcast.com/)

## [Rule of three](https://www.ruleofthreepod.com/)
Joel Morris & Jason Hazeley interview “somebody who makes comedy to talk about something funny that they love. By taking it apart maybe we will learn something about how comedy works, or we will just quote bits from it and giggle until we are finished”.

## [Freakonomics radio](https://freakonomics.com/)
Freakonomics “explores the hidden side of everything” through the lens of economics and public policy.
